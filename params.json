{"name":"Escape-the-underworld","tagline":"","body":"#Welcome to Escape the Underworld\r\n\r\nThis game is a university project about a game inspired by [Zork](http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fzdungeon.z5).\r\nAlso, I must say it is inspired in Greek Mythology.\r\n\r\n##Background\r\n\r\nThe history begins while your empire is in war with another one, unfortunately the city you live in is a strategic point, and you are a renowned soldier. Your empire is losing the war but your side had a witch, who had a vision on how to win the war: She saw a powerful object that some man could use and use it to won the war, the only problem is the object is trapped somewhere in the underworld, so you and other renowned soldiers are chosen to go find it.\r\nThe only way known to enter the underworld for a human is that some wizards or witches work together and create a portal to it, so that was what was done, but the empire hadnâ€™t enough wizards/witches and when the portal was created and you entered you were the only one that had tie to cross it. Now you are alone in somewhere of the Underworld.\r\n\r\n##Map\r\n\r\n![Escape the Underworld Map](http://s22.postimg.org/l2h8qs7oh/mapa_etu.jpg)\r\n\r\n##Wiki\r\n\r\nYou can check my wiki [here](https://github.com/marclafr/Escape-the-Underworld/wiki) if you want more detailed information.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
