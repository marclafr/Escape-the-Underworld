Instructions to play the game:

	MOVEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
		There are 4 directions, north, south, east and west,
		The commands to move in each direction are 3, all of them functionals:
			Typing "n", "north", or "go north", you will move north.
			Typing "s", south" or "go south" you will move south.
			Typing "e", "east", or "go east", you will move east.
			Typing "w", "west", or "go west", you will move west.
		If you type a direction and there is no path, the game will say "You can't go that way.".
		The command "go" alone doesn't work but the game itself request you to use a direction with it.

	LOOK COMMAND:
		if you type "look", the game will descrive the place where you are.
		if you type a direction with "look", e.g. "look north" you will get the description of the place you have in the north
		of your position, if there is nothing in the north, the game will say "Nothing to see here...".

	OPEN/CLOSE COMMANDS:
		There are a couple of rooms that can be closed and opened (they start closed, so you will notice which they are), to
		open or close them, first type "open"/"close", then the game will ask you the direction the door is. If there is no
		door you won't be able to open/close it.
		NOTICE!: The game won't understand if you type, e.g. "Open north" directly.

	HELP:
		If you don't remember the instructions, by writing "help" a menu with all the commands will appear in the screen.

	EXIT THE GAME:
		Just introduce the command "quit".
